* Top notch testing; THAT SAID: you'll find that most sites _do not_ test near
  this much.  It's just too much labor sent to a non-visibly productive end.
* This is a really solid app.  My main points here are is watch out for too
  much calculation in the view.  In some places you're embedding a lot of
  hidden tags or doing some string-ugly logic to get something to work.  I
  think in most of those cases this was occasioned by dealing with the
  polymorphic issues.  But in some of the cases, I think the thing you wanted
  was available either in the session or in the params.  I can't be entirely
  certain on all of those, but keep things open.
* Your routes and controllers were very nice.
* Very solid project that shows Rails is on your side as yu go into final
  projects.
